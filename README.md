# GPA_Calculator
This is a GPA calculator made for the QUT grading system. The aim was to create a basic WPF application that could aid me in my 
university studies and form a better understanding of the WPF Framework. <br/><br/>

Functionality: <br/> 
- Input your assignment grades into the calculator and convert it to a grade scale number! <br/> <br/> 

Improvements <br/>
- Make it more appealing to the user <br/> <br/>
